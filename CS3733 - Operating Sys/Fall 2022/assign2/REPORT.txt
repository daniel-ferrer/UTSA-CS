1. I did not collaborate with anoyone on this assignment

2. For the most part yes, but I did run into issues with getting my RR
   scheduling function to produce the correct output based on the input file

3. Everything seems to be working with the given text file besides the output of RR

4. The assignment took me a long time to complete and I feel like I could've programmed a more efficient solution
   but overall it was interesting to implement these CPU scheduling algorithms in C
